# 🚗 Smart Parking System – Step by Step Guide

This document explains how to build the Smart Parking System using Arduino, IR sensors, a servo motor, and an LCD display.

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Components

- Arduino Uno ×1
- IR Sensor Modules ×2
- Servo Motor SG90 ×1
- LCD 16x2 with I2C Module ×1
- Jumper Wires × multiple
- Breadboard (optional)

---

## 🔌 Step 2: Wiring the Components

### IR Sensors
- IR1 VCC → 5V
- IR1 GND → GND
- IR1 OUT → D2  
- IR2 OUT → D3  

### Servo Motor
- Servo VCC (Red) → 5V  
- Servo GND (Brown) → GND  
- Servo Signal (Orange) → D4

### LCD I2C (0x27)
- SDA → A4  
- SCL → A5  
- VCC → 5V  
- GND → GND

## 🧠 Step 3: Upload the Code

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the required libraries:
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
   - `Wire.h`
   - `Servo.h`
3. Upload the provided code file `Arduino Code.txt` to the Arduino board.

## ⚙️ Step 4: Test the System

### Entrance
- Put your hand (or object) in front of **IR1**.
- The gate opens (servo rotates).
- The slot count decreases.

### Exit
- Put your hand in front of **IR2**.
- The gate opens (servo rotates).
- The slot count increases.

## 🧪 Step 5: LCD Behavior

- Shows welcome message on startup.
- Constantly displays:  
  `Fadel: X` where X is available slots.
- When full (slot = 0), shows:  
  `Mfe4 Mkan :(`

---

## 💡 Step 6: Customize

- Change total slots: edit `int Slot = 4;` at the top.
- Adjust servo angles if needed:
  - Gate open → `myservo.write(10);`
  - Gate closed → `myservo.write(110);`

## ✅ Project Completed

Congratulations! Your Smart Parking System is now fully working.
